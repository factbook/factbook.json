      "text": "The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and the Southern Ocean). The Northwest Passage (US and Canada) and Northern Sea Route (Norway and Russia) are two important seasonal waterways. In recent years the polar ice pack has receded in the summer allowing for increased navigation and raising the possibility of future sovereignty and shipping disputes among the six countries bordering the Arctic Ocean (Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Iceland, Norway, Russia, US)."

        "text": "Composed of water and in a fluid state, the oceans are delimited differently than the solid continents. Oceans are divided into three zones based on depth and light level. Although some sea creatures depend on light to live, others can do without it. Sunlight entering the water may travel about 1,000 m into the oceans under the right conditions, but there is rarely any significant light beyond 200 m.<br><br>The upper 200 m (656 ft) of oceans is called the euphotic, or \"sunlight,\" zone. This zone contains the vast majority of commercial fisheries and is home to many protected marine mammals and sea turtles. Only a small amount of light penetrates beyond this depth. <br><br>The zone between 200 m (656 ft) and 1,000 m (3,280 ft) is usually referred to as the \"twilight\" zone, but is officially the dysphotic zone. In this zone, the intensity of light rapidly dissipates as depth decreases. Such a minuscule amount of light penetrates beyond a depth of 200 m that photosynthesis is no longer possible.<br><br>The aphotic, or \"midnight,\" zone exists in depths below 1,000 m (3,280 ft). Sunlight does not penetrate to these depths and the zone is bathed in darkness."
