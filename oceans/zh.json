      "text": "The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than the Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean). The Kiel Canal (Germany), Oresund (Denmark-Sweden), Bosporus (Turkey), Strait of Gibraltar (Morocco-Spain), and the Saint Lawrence Seaway (Canada-US) are important strategic access waterways. The decision by the International Hydrographic Organization in the spring of 2000 to delimit a fifth world ocean, the Southern Ocean, removed the portion of the Atlantic Ocean south of 60 degrees south latitude. For convenience and because of its immense size, the Atlantic Ocean is often divided at the Equator and designated as the North Atlantic Ocean and the South Atlantic Ocean."

The waters along the <em>continental shelf</em> are usually productive in both plant and animal life, both from sunlight and nutrients from ocean upwelling and terrestrial runoff.

Sunlight does not penetrate to these depths, having been absorbed or reflected in the water above.

Tracing their way around the global ocean, this system of underwater volcanoes forms the longest mountain range on Earth. Fracture Zones are linear transform faults that develop perpendicular to the line of the mid-ocean ridge which can offset the ridge line and divide it into segments.The Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone displaces the mid-ocean ridge 350 km to the west separating the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from the Reykjanes Ridge. The Romanche Fracture Zone, located near the Equator, offsets the Mid-Atlantic Ridge 900 km and is considered the dividing line between the North and South Atlantic Oceans.

A circular collapse caldera is often centered at the summit, evidence of a magma chamber within the volcano. Flat topped <em>seamounts</em> are known as <em>guyots</em>. Long chains of <em>seamounts</em> are often fed by \"hot spots\" in the deep mantle. These hot spots are associated with stationary plumes of molten rock rising from deep within the Earth's mantle. These hot spot plumes melt through the overlying tectonic plate as it moves and supplies magma to the active volcanic island at the end of the chain of volcanic islands and <em>seamounts</em>. The following are examples of <em>seamounts</em> found on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.<br> <p>Bermuda Rise (Figure 2)<br>Cape Verde Plateau (Figure 2)<br>New England Seamounts (Figure 2)<br>Rio Grande Plateau (Figure 3)<br>Rockall Plateau (Figure 2)</p>"

The location where the sinking of a plate occurs is called a subduction zone. Subduction can occur when oceanic crust collides with and sinks under (subducts) continental crust resulting in volcanic, seismic, and mountain-building processes. Subduction can also occur in the convergence of two oceanic plates where one will sink under the other and in the process create a deep <em>ocean trench</em>. Subduction processes in oceanic-oceanic plate convergence also result in the formation of volcanoes. Over millions of years, the erupted lava and volcanic debris pile up on the ocean floor until a submarine volcano rises above sea level to form a <em>volcanic island</em>. Such volcanoes are typically strung out in chains called island arcs. As the name implies, volcanic island arcs, which closely parallel the <em>trenches</em>, are generally curved. The following are examples of <em>ocean trenches</em> found on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.<br> <p>Cayman Trench (Caribbean Sea) (Figure 2)<br>Hellenic Trench (Mediterranean Sea) (Figure 4)<br>Puerto Rico Trench (Figure 2); note - deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean <br>South Sandwich Trench (South Atlantic) (Figure 3)</p>"

Then, over time, the high elevation of the island collapses and erodes away to sea level leaving behind an outline of the island in the form of the fringing coral reef. The resulting low island is typified by the coral reef surrounding a low elevation of sand and coral above sea level with an interior shallow lagoon. Often times the remaining dry land is broken into a ring of islets. Some lagoons can be hundreds of square kilometers. It may take as long as 300,000 years for an <em>atoll</em> formation to occur. <em>Guyots </em>are submerged atoll structures, which explains why they are flat topped seamounts.
